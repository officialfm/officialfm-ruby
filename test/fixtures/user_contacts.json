    "profile":"We are quite aware that it sounds like the classical band story, but ours is true. Peters started when four lads (The Netherlands, Venezuela, France and Switzerland) decided to form a band to avoid being dead bored at school. It was a bit like at three everyone grabs an instrument and rock! Kind of funny considering that none of us knew how to play. But who needs that to play indie tunes anyway?\n\nThree months later, we were on stage for our first gig and, ever since that night, it has been quite hard to loose this addiction to sweat, pleasure and final satisfaction (hey, don\'t get confused! We are still talking about performing music on stage)\n\nWe have done numerous gigs in clubs and festivals, in Switzerland and abroad, for one person (yes, indeed) or for a few thousands and issued, as of today, two EP and two albums.\n\nHaving a band and being on the road is cool, you should try too. It has led us to discover places we would never have known and share the stage with bands such as Suede (UK), Ghinzu (Belgium), Dover (Spain), Liquido (Germany), The Godfathers (UK), Poni Hoax (France), Shed Seven (UK), A.S.Dragon (France), Salad (UK), Lovebugs (CH), The Sheer (NL) and many others.",
